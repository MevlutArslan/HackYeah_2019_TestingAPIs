"Jarrid loved the Lord and had a servant's heart. He was vibrant, positive, and was always serving and helping others," he wrote on the church's website."Jarrid also repeatedly dealt with depression and was very open about his ongoing struggles," Mr Laurie added. "He wanted to especially help those who were dealing with suicidal thoughts."Another pastor at the church, Jason Powell, also paid tribute.It’s with the deepest sadness of heart that I found out that my good friend @jarridwilson went home to be with the Lord last night.Jarrid was not just a brother in the Lord but a dear and trusted friend.

"Loving Jesus doesn't always cure suicidal thoughts. Loving Jesus doesn't always cure depression," he wrote."But that doesn't mean Jesus doesn't offer us companionship and comfort," he continued. "He ALWAYS does that."A fundraiser to support Wilson's family has raised more than $42,000 (£34,000) as of Wednesday.If you or someone you know is struggling with issues raised by this story, find support through BBC Action Line.
